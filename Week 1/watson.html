<H1>IBM founder Thomas J. Watson Sr.</H1>
<p>Thomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 â€“ June 19, 1956) was an American businessman who served as the chairman and CEO of IBM.
      He oversaw the company's growth into an international force from
       1914 to 1956. Watson developed IBM's management style and corporate
        culture from John Henry Patterson's training at NCR. He turned the 
        company into a highly effective selling organization, based largely
         on punched card tabulating machines. A leading self-made
          industrialist,[4] he was one of the richest men of his time 
          and was called the world's greatest salesman when he died in
           1956.</p>
